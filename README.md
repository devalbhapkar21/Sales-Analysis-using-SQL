## Procedure

The analysis follows these general steps:

1. **Data Preparation**: Create the `WalmartSales` database and the `sales` table using the `walmart_table_create.sql` script. This script also includes queries for feature engineering, such as adding columns for `time_of_day`, `day_name`, and `month_name`.

2. **Data Loading**: Import the sales data into the `sales` table.

3. **Analysis Execution**: Open the `Sales-And-Customer-Analysis.sql` and `generic_product_analysis.sql` files and execute the SQL queries to analyze various aspects of the data.

4. **Result Interpretation**: Interpret the query results to gain insights into sales trends, customer behaviors, product performance, revenue generation, and other relevant metrics.

## Results

The SQL queries in this repository provide valuable insights into the Walmart sales data. Some key findings include:

- Identification of peak sales hours and days of the week, which can inform staffing and inventory management decisions.
